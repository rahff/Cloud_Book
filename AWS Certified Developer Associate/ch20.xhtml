<p class="noindentb">In this chapter, we will discuss various ways of creating static websites using Amazon S3.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch20lev1sec1">Amazon S3</h3>
<p class="noindent"><a href="ch08.xhtml#ch8">Chapter 8</a> explored Amazon S3 and its different components in detail. It is an object storage service that can be used to store objects in buckets. It can also be used to deploy static websites, which have the following advantages:</p>
<p class="bullett">• It is easy to set up static websites in Amazon S3.</p>
<p class="bulleta">• It provides cost savings, as there are no web servers or databases to manage.</p>
<p class="bulleta">• You can host the static website using Amazon Route 53.</p>
<p class="bulleta">• You can deliver the contents locally using Amazon CloudFront.</p>
<p class="bulleta">• You can use Amazon Route 53 to manage your custom domain.</p>
<p class="bulleta">• You can deliver the contents securely using SSL from Amazon Certificate Manager.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch20lev1sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_500"/>Deploy a Static Website Using Amazon S3</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is easy and simple to create a static website in Amazon S3. The following will take you on a step-by-step journey of creating a simple website.</p>
<p class="numbert"><strong>1.</strong> First log in to your AWS console, navigate to the Amazon S3 service page, and click Create Bucket.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0500-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>2.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_501"/>As shown next, a new Amazon S3 bucket called amazondeveloper.ml was created successfully.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0501-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>3.</strong> Click on the bucket name and select the Properties tab.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0501-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>4.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_502"/>In order to make this Amazon S3 bucket a static website, select the Static Website Hosting box.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Images" src="f0502-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>5.</strong> Select the option Use The Bucket To Host A Website and enter your index and error page.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Images" src="f0502-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>6.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_503"/>Now static website hosting is enabled. Click on the Permissions tab to give read-only access to your objects.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Images" src="f0503-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>7.</strong> You can find the following Amazon read-only policy from the Amazon documentation (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-2">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-2</a>). You need to update the bucket name to the new Amazon S3 bucket name that we created in step 2.</p>
<p class="numberc"><img alt="Images" src="p0503-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>8.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_504"/>Enter the policy and click Save.</p>
<div class="siden">
<p class="imagen"><img alt="Images" class="inlinen" src="note.jpg"/></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>   See the warning from AWS about granting public access to an Amazon S3 bucket, and never grant anonymous access unless it is absolutely necessary, such as when hosting a static website on Amazon S3.</p>
</div>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0504-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>9.</strong> You will see a warning in the Permissions tab regarding the bucket policy, since this bucket has public access.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0504-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>10.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_505"/>Now click the Overview tab to upload your HTML files and images.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0505-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>11.</strong> Create two simple HTML files in your local machine. You can use the following sample code to create your index.html file.</p>
<p class="numberc"><img alt="Images" src="p0505-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="numberc"><img alt="Images" src="p0506-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_506"/><strong>12.</strong> You can create a sample error.html page using the following sample code:</p>
<p class="numberc"><img alt="Images" src="p0506-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_507"/><strong>13.</strong> Just replace nature1.jpg and sky1.jpg with pictures of your choice and upload them.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0507-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>14.</strong> Choose the Standard storage class, since you will be frequently accessing this static site, as shown next. Note that here you have options to select Intelligent Tiering, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier, Glacier Deep Archive, and Reduced Redundancy based on your requirements. Also, you have the option to encrypt the object using either the Amazon S3 master key or AWS KMS master key.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0507-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>15.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_508"/>Here you can review all the options that you chose so far and update if necessary by clicking on the Previous button, shown next. If everything looks good, click the Upload button to upload the files.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0508-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>16.</strong> Once the upload is successful, it will take you to the bucket, where you can view all the uploaded objects. Now the building of a simple static website is complete using Amazon S3.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0508-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>17.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_509"/>You can access your new static website using your bucket name URL—for example, <a href="http://amazondeveloper.ml.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com">amazondeveloper.ml.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</a>—without provisioning any web server or database.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0509-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>18.</strong> You can also access your website using the index.html URL—for example, <a href="http://amazondeveloper.ml.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html">amazondeveloper.ml.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html</a>.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0509-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>19.</strong> Similarly, you can access your website error page using the error.html URL—for example, <a href="http://amazondeveloper.ml.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/error.html">amazondeveloper.ml.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/error.html</a>.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0509-03.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>20.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_510"/>As a developer, you know very well that we need to test our implementation. So, let us enter the incorrect URL and see whether it displays the error page. You can add some word like “cloudy” at the end of the URL to test this—for example, <a href="http://amazondeveloper.ml.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cloudy">amazondeveloper.ml.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cloudy</a>.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0510-01.jpg"/></p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch20lev1sec3">Deploy a Static Website Using Amazon S3 and Amazon Route 53</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can create the Amazon S3 static website using a custom URL and host it in Amazon Route 53. You can get a free domain from the freenom site that can be used for building your static website.</p>
<p class="numbert"><strong>1.</strong> Go to <a href="https://www.freenom.com">https://www.freenom.com</a> and look for any domain name of your choice—for example, I checked amazondeveloper.ml.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0510-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>2.</strong> If the domain is available, you will see an option to select it.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0510-03.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>3.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_511"/>When you click on Checkout after logging in, it will take you to the next page. Click Continue.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0511-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>4.</strong> Next you will see the Review And Checkout page, where you can complete the order to get your new domain (which you will have to pay for after 12 months).</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0511-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>5.</strong> Now, you can go back to your AWS console and navigate to Amazon Route 53. Here you can see options for DNS management, traffic management, availability monitoring, and domain registration. Choose DNS Management to host your new domain.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0511-03.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>6.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_512"/>The DNS management dashboard will appear, where you can create a hosted zone.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0512-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>7.</strong> Enter your domain name—for example, <strong>amazondeveloper.ml</strong>—in the Domain Name field, select Public Hosted Zone for the Type, and click the Create button.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0512-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>8.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_513"/>Note the namespace values that you need to update in the <a href="https://www.freenom.com">https://www.freenom.com</a> website.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0513-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>9.</strong> Now, go to <a href="https://wwwfreenom.com">https://wwwfreenom.com</a> and navigate to Services | My Domains. Enter the namespace values from the previous step.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0513-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>10.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_514"/>Navigate back to the AWS console and go to Amazon Route 53 DNS Management, and create Record Set, shown next. Select the Type as A and leave the name blank. For Alias, select Yes, and select the Amazon S3 bucket that we created in the previous exercise from the dropdown for Alias Target. Select Simple for the Routing Policy and leave Evaluate Target Health set to No. After reviewing all the options, click the Create button.</p>
<div class="siden">
<p class="imagen"><img alt="Images" class="inlinen" src="note.jpg"/></p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>   Set Evaluate Target Health to Yes for production implementations and for a failover routing policy.</p>
</div>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0514-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>11.</strong> Now you have successfully hosted your Amazon S3 static website using your custom domain in Amazon Route 53. You can type your custom URL in your browser and press <span class="smallcaps">enter</span> to see your new site.</p>
<p class="number1"><strong>12.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_515"/>As you did before, test your implementation by adding any word at the end. The error.html page should appear and display the custom error message.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0515-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number1"><strong>13.</strong> You also should be able to reach your website index.html page by entering <strong>/index.html</strong> at the end of your custom URL.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0515-02.jpg"/></p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch20lev1sec4">Deploy a Static Website Using Amazon S3, Amazon Route 53, and Amazon CloudFront</h3>
<p class="noindent">Your website has become very popular, and you have customers worldwide now. You can add Amazon CloudFront to deliver globally with low latency and high performance from the nearby points of presence (PoPs). Also, you can secure access to your site by using SSL.</p>
<p class="numbert"><strong>1.</strong> Log in to your AWS console and navigate to the Amazon CloudFront service. Click Get Started under the Web delivery method.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="images" src="f0515-03.jpg"/></p>
<p class="number"><strong>2.</strong> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_516"/>Enter your Amazon S3 bucket name in the Origin Domain Name field, and enter your domain name for the Origin ID—for example, amazondeveloper.ml—shown next.
