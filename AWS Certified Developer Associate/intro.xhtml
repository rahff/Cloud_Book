You will then create your first Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This book will take you on a journey of using some of the important services such as Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, AWS CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, Amazon EBS, Amazon EFS, Amazon S3 Glacier, Amazon RDS, and Amazon DynamoDB from the exam point of view, as well as building your experience for working in real-world scenarios.</p>
<p class="indent">This book will prepare you much more than just passing the AWS Developer exam—you will be able to perform the expected tasks of an AWS-certified developer in the real world.</p>
<p class="bullett">• <a href="ch00_fm09_part1.xhtml#part1">Part I</a> starts with taking the first step of your exciting AWS Cloud journey by providing an overview of cloud computing and AWS Cloud. You will then create an AWS free account and install the necessary developer tools, such as AWS CLI, to interact with AWS programmatically, in addition to teaching you tasks such as creating Amazon VPC and Amazon EC2 using the AWS Management Console.</p>
<p class="bulleta">• <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxix"/><a href="ch04_part2.xhtml#part2">Part II</a> introduces you to the core cloud concepts such as Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling, which help you build highly scalable applications. Then you will learn about AWS CloudFront, which is a fast content delivery network (CDN) that securely delivers your application data to your worldwide customers, and Amazon Route 53, which is a managed, highly available cloud domain name system.</p>
<p class="bulleta">• <a href="ch07_part3.xhtml#part3">Part III</a> describes various cloud storage services such as Amazon S3, which offers high availability, scalability, and security with 99.999999999 percent durability for the data stored in Amazon S3 buckets, and Amazon S3 Glacier, which is used to easily archive your data using simple life cycle policies. Then you will learn about Amazon EFS, which is a managed elastic network file system, and you will also learn about EBS volumes and how to use them for your mission-critical applications and the most demanding workloads that require block storage.</p>
<p class="bulleta">• <a href="ch09_part4.xhtml#part4">Part IV</a> discusses authentication and authorization, where you will learn to secure your AWS resources using Identity and Access Management (IAM) and configure users, groups, and policies to allow or deny access.
